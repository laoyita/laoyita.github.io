  A stunning place where you could stand back to watch and listen to the waves for 
  hours…
That said, maybe I’m not getting the full experience. It also looks like a lovely place 
to get washed out to sea while trying to get your Instagram pics!

  You can either walk (around 2 miles one way, 45 minutes) or pay to ride the “shuttle”. 
  The shuttle meets at the entrance to the trail. You can pay onboard with a credit card 
  without a reservation or you can book online. The cost is round trip there is no one 
  way amount. Once the shuttle drops you off you have about 30 minutes at the location 
  or you can wait for another 30 minutes. It’s an interesting site if you have the time. 
  The plane has been used in music videos. The parking lot is paid parking via a QR Code, 
  although it’s not clear if it’s actually enforced. There is no toilet in this parking.
  this place requests a parking fee. However there are no cameras or attendants. 
  So it’s up to you if you pay the parking.

<b>E<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5GeYC4bT11Dov4Xa8"> Skógafoss Waterfall </a> 
  An absolutely amazing waterfall!!! You can get super close to the waterfall and it is 
  just a great experience. You can also choose to walk up the mountain side and it’s 
  about 432 steps, so it’s not easy to climb them! It’s free and one of the most 
  stunning waterfalls I’ve ever seen:)<br/>
  Highly recommend. There’s a lot of people at the bottom and top viewing area which have 
  good views; however, once you go past the viewing area there is a trail that goes on 
  forever. The coolest part is that you’re surrounded by beautiful views (just as pretty as 
  Skogafoss) surrounding you. The views on the trail were just breathtaking and I was not 
  expecting this when I first came to Skogafoss. I’m so happy I came here and there’s so much 
  more to see here than just the waterfall!!

<b>F<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Yk5rCNYXKWUT6jbH7">Seljalandsfoss </a> 
  Surely one of the most beautiful waterfalls on the island.  This place is one of the few that offers 
  unobstructed access to access the back of the waterfall and thus have another view of 
  this phenomenon.  need to pay for parking. a lot of tourists all the time.
