<b>B<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FyGCvCCzKHQ5qFmk8"> Nykurhylsfoss (Sveinsstekksfoss)</a> 
  This waterfall was quite powerful when we were there in mid-Nov. It is a paved road up to the waterfall and a parking area. It is then just a short and easy walk to the viewpoint. If you continue up the road 
  there is a picturesque opening near where you can see the river that feeds the waterfall.
<br/><br/>
<b>C<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/StzhG5UU4TcyuZ796"> Vestrahorn</a> 
  The view of the mountain is breathtaking. Only downside is you have to pay to enter 
  in the Viking cafe. They will provide a map and there is a farm to walk to, 
  but it isn’t worth the walk to see that. Just go to the mountain.
   On the drive there you may see some horses grazing on the grass with the 
   mountain in the background which is so peaceful!
   <br/>
   The Google maps doesn’t show the directions to get here but if you look for the directions for Viking Village Prop for Movies  , it brings you right here ….. of course you need to pay to get to these shallow water with Vestrahorn in the backdrop , but the weather plays a big role in how you are able to see it , we got there in a rainy foggy day , so it wasn’t as we had seen in the pictures.

<b>E<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wD1HEkgyABM63kTo7"> Jökulsárlón Main Parking </a> 
  Great parking location for both the glacier lake and the east side of diamond beach.
   Seals, sea birds, glacial ice. Great toilets, food and drink stands, and access to
    boat and kayak tours.
    Free parking, free restrooms.
<br/><br/>
<b>F<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/g5vvCfiqZ2GHi7P29">Fjallsárlón Glacier Parking </a> 
  Parking was free
  2 minutes walk to the impressive glacier.The restrooms at the adjacent cafe are free with any purchase 
  ( or a nominal fee otherwise). 10min easy walk to the Glacier lake.
<br/><br/>
<b>G<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/X4vWijzhNJmZR4k89"> Svínafellsjökull Parking </a> 
  The parking lot is a good starting point if you want to get closer to the Svinafellsjökul glacier. 
  Around 15 minutes walk (one direction).
<br/><br/>
<b>I<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/a2ddxJNooZ1Tggfy6"> Skaftafell Glacier </a> 
  Easy flat walk from the visitor's center, but alot of sand at the end to get close to the glacier. 
  About 3km round trip. Defintely worth it to get that close to a glacier, but we did like the
   Svínafellsjökull Glacier better because of the lake at the end with floating icebergs.
    Each are equally beautiful and worth seeing though.
<br/><br/>
