<b>B<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FyGCvCCzKHQ5qFmk8"> Nykurhylsfoss (Sveinsstekksfoss)</a> 
  This waterfall was quite powerful when we were there in mid-Nov. It is a paved road up to the waterfall and a parking area. It is then just a short and easy walk to the viewpoint. If you continue up the road 
  there is a picturesque opening near where you can see the river that feeds the waterfall.

<b>C<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/StzhG5UU4TcyuZ796"> Vestrahorn</a> 
  The view of the mountain is breathtaking. Only downside is you have to pay to enter 
  in the Viking cafe. They will provide a map and there is a farm to walk to, 
  but it isn’t worth the walk to see that. Just go to the mountain.
   On the drive there you may see some horses grazing on the grass with the 
   mountain in the background which is so peaceful!

<b>E<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wD1HEkgyABM63kTo7"> Jökulsárlón Main Parking </a> 
  Great parking location for both the glacier lake and the east side of diamond beach.
   Seals, sea birds, glacial ice. Great toilets, food and drink stands, and access to
    boat and kayak tours.
    Free parking, free restrooms.

<b>F<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EYjz6rPo2pKuJB5x9"> Hverir Parking </a> Not good reviews from Google Map
<br/><br/>
<b>H<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AMwoduHAPVcr6rGo8"> Viti Crater Parking </a> 
  Free parking right at the crater. To reach the top of it it’s a short but very very steep hike of about 10 minutes. At the top you have a nice view down into the crater as well as over the whole area around. If you are traveling around the ring road, it’s worth to spend the half hour for a short visit.
