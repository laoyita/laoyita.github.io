  Gonna give some some extra details for this great waterfall. Parking is free. Also, had the trail to ourselves until another couple showed up later. You enter from the parking lot through a man gate on the side of the car gate. Follow the trail to a fence that says to go to the left and follow the stream to get to the top. After that I crudely illustrated two choices. The blue way, if you have waterproof boots up to your ankles, you can cross the stream where it’s low. Then follow it to what looks like a very close spot by the base of the falls. The red way, if you don’t have waterproof shoes, you can follow the fence til it crosses the stream. At that point there’s a knoll where the barbed wire fence has fallen over to about knee height. You can cross there easily and follow the stream up to a good spot by the falls. I didn’t go the left way but if you are prepared it definitely seems like a higher pay off spot to take photos.

    IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM THE LANDOWNER: The mud road to the river is now closed, due to damage from intense traffic. Please either (1) park your car at the bottom of the hill leading up to the farmhouse and walk from there along the mud road until just before the bridge, then walk up along the river; please DO NOT go down to where the summerhouse is!!! or (2) drive up the hill and park beyond the red farmhouse, then go through the gate in the fence and CLOSE THE GATE!! otherwise the horses and sheep will escape and I will get very angry with you; then proceed over the fields to the left - you need to cross another fence on the way. Either way, please DO NOT ignore the road closure!

    This place does not well marked parking place. Finding parking is tricky. Don't follow Google map, it will take you to a different location. Take left just before the N1 petrol pump. Drive on the gravel road till the bridge and park anywhere on the field. Follow the hiking path. There are 3 waterfalls.
<br/>
To get there: Coming from the South, you'll turn left before the A1 gas station. There will be no signage, but you'll see a dirt driveway that goes toward a Bed & Breakfast called Fagrabrekka. About 100 yards before the house, you can turn left. It feels like a field drive, but follow that until you get to a fence. You can park along the fence line. You'll hike about 300 meters along the water (crawl over the fence where the wooden ladder has been built) and continue following the water until you reach the falls.
