The best stop to get off the London Big Bus to visit Kensington Palace is the Kensington Palace stop (34) on the Blue Route. This stop is located just a short walk from the palace entrance. The Blue Route runs from East to West, so you can hop on the bus at any stop along the route and get off at Gloucester Road.
<br/>
Westminster is a major interchange station where you can change to the Big Bus on either the Red or Blue Route.
