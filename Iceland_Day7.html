  The road to get here is very rough. More rough than the F road to get to Landmannalaugar. So be warned. Our Toyota Land Cruiser handled it fine.
   This waterfall area is incredible and should be a must visit. But when we were there 
   awe only saw one other car.
   Gravel road is a bit bumpy, but it's only 7km from asphalt road. Waterfalls definitely worth to see. 
   From the edge of the clif 
   you can see enormous space with beautiful views. Parking is free.

<b>C<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fcoLoJoCJy8SNg9AA">Gullfoss Falls</a> 
Beautiful and impressive waterfalls. We came aroud noon and it was very crowded.
Free entrance and free parking.
There's toilet in the the shop/restaurant inside that you can use for free.
Must visit while on the Golden circle tour. It is huge and majestic. More likely that you could spot a rainbow. From the car park, 
it was about 400-500 m hike and it should not be missed.
<br/><br/>
<b>D<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HqXL7ykTgMpFsuzz6"> Geysir Parking </a> 
  Very nicely done, roped all to allow all a nice view. Getlysir goes off ever 6-15 minutes. 
  Best place to park to see the Geysir. Just park anywhere, there is no parking fee nor entrance fee.

<br/><br/>
<b>E<b>:<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/aJsrmvofcRxMHLnA7"> Thingvellir National Park </a>
  If the weather is good, this a beautiful place to begin your exploration of Iceland's
   landscape. Plenty of walking paths, leading to rivers, waterfalls and tectonic splits.
    Several toilet blocks are provided. Also a shop which sells souvenirs and 
    refreshments.
